        <p class="lead mb-4">I have so far completed about 14 years of schooling in total. I graduated high school with a 4.3 GPA and was number 26 in my class. I was an honors and AP student throughout high school and thanks to that I already had an idea of what college was going to be like. I am currently studying at UC Riverside and in my second year. My major is in Education, Society, and Culture. So far I love my major and my peers and just the environment overall. I even think about double majoring in Liberal Studies so that when I consider graduate school, I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about some exams plus paying extra for something that I could technically do for free. For something like this, one has to plan way ahead or else you might regret it later on. 
<br><br>

        Throughout high school, until now I have never worked. I was always told that if I worked my focus wouldnâ€™t be 100% on my studies. I always kind of felt left out in a way because most of my friends worked and I didnâ€™t. I didnâ€™t let that bring me down so I just stayed focused on my studies and tried the best that I could. Then I graduated high school and summer was just around the corner. I thought about getting a summer job so I could pass the time meanwhile I entered school. I thought it was a great idea until the FAFSA form came around. It then stated that if I enter any work experience or such it would be likely that I would be given less aid and possibly have to pay. This drew me back because I already had my mind set on working but with this, I knew my family and I couldnâ€™t afford to pay out of pocket for my schooling so I had no choice but to not work. So summer passed by and then I entered school. 
<br><br>

        Although I have never officially worked, I can say that I do have some experience with others. For example, in high school, a club I was in volunteered to run the concession stand during a football homecoming game. In a few words, it was a very busy and very hectic but fun experience overall. Although we didnâ€™t get paid, we still made around $500 just that night. We dealt with some impatient customers, rude customers, nice customers, everything. It was as though I was working retail in a way. Another example is similar to the previous one but this one was a part of my community. I volunteered to sell to sell concessions during a Fourth of July event. A similar experience occurred here too. So one can say that I do have some knowledge of what occurs in places like this and I know how to overcome obstacles when presented at any given moment. These two opportunities allowed me to build my communication skills, teamwork skills, and time management skills. If I handled a high school homecoming football game, I think I can handle just about anything.
